/* ========================================
   VIBE.UI - ALL STYLES
   Complete CSS bundle for Vibe.UI component library

   This file imports all Vibe.UI CSS resources for convenience.
   For production apps, consider importing only what you need.
   ======================================== */

/* ========================================
   BASE STYLES (REQUIRED)
   Foundation styles including CSS variables, themes, reset, and animations
   ======================================== */
@import url('./vibe-base.css');

/* ========================================
   UTILITY CLASSES (OPTIONAL)
   Helper classes for layout, typography, spacing, colors, etc.
   Comment out this import if you don't need utility classes.
   ======================================== */
@import url('./vibe-utilities.css');

/* ========================================
   SCOPED COMPONENT STYLES (AUTOMATIC)

   Component-specific styles are automatically bundled by Blazor
   and included via the Vibe.UI.styles.css bundle. You don't need
   to import them manually.

   The bundle is generated at build time from all *.razor.css files
   and automatically scoped to prevent style conflicts.

   To use the scoped bundle in your app, add this to your HTML:
   <link href="_content/Vibe.UI/Vibe.UI.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />

   Note: The scoped bundle is separate from this file and must be
   referenced independently in your app's layout.
